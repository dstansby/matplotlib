``LogLocator`` now respects ``numticks``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The algorithm within `~matplotlib.ticker.LogLocator` has been modified to
respect the ``numticks`` argument. Whereas previously more ticks than
``numticks`` could be returned, ``numticks`` is now an upper limit on the
number of ticks returned.

In some cases, this change results in one more tick being added on a
log-scaled axis, and correctly adds some ticks to log-scaled errorbar plots
that were previously missing.
