Getting help
------------
Matplotlib is a welcoming, inclusive project, and we follow the `Python
Software Foundation Code of Conduct <coc_>`_ in everything we do.

Check the :doc:`FAQ <../faq/index>` and the :doc:`API <../api/index>` docs.

For help, join the `gitter channel`_ and the matplotlib-users_,
matplotlib-devel_, and matplotlib-announce_ mailing lists, or check out the
Matplotlib tag on stackoverflow_.  The `search <search.html>`_ tool searches
all of the documentation, including full text search of over 350 complete
examples which exercise almost every corner of Matplotlib.

You can file bugs, patches and feature requests on the `issue tracker`_, but it
is a good idea to ping us on the mailing list too.

To keep up to date with what's going on in Matplotlib, see the :doc:`what's
new <whats_new>` page or browse the `source code`_.  Anything that could
require changes to your existing code is logged in the :doc:`API changes
<../api/api_changes>` file.
